This is a personal portfolio about me: Moritz Horch.

## Tooling

In the following, one can find the used technologies.

### Svelte

As I personally use React for work, I wanted to use another tooling for frontend development this time. Svelte itself works at compile time and therefore works without a virtual dom to start and stay fast. Additionally, it brings reactivity to JavaScript without the need for further state management libraries. [1](#sources)

### Prettier

In this project I used Prettier as my choice for an opinionated code formatter. Personally, I prefer using widely-known tools and opinionated solutions as they provide steadiness in an ever-changing environment: web development. Prettier supports the editors I'm familiar with (IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code) and can not only format standard JavaScript or TypeScript, but is also extendable and therefore suitable for Svelte.
